## Introduction (Aug. 25)

To get us thinking critically about the concept of History before turning our
attention to the Spanish Inquisition, we will spend some time reading about
History and Progress from a philosophical perspective, and set some primary
categories of method and politics on the table.

We start the semester with four short pieces. Two address the natural and
possible limits of historical knowledge and temporality. Two move us towards
looking over the Inquisitor's shoulder. While reading, consider this big
question: *What is the status of the past?*. 

* Tosaka Jun, "The Principle of Everydayness and Historical Time," pp. 3-16 in
  Ken C. Kawashima, Fabian Schäfer, and Robert Stolz, eds., *Tosaka Jun:
  A Critical Reader* (Columbia University East Asia Program, 2013).

* Walter Benjamin, "Theses on the Philosophy of History," pp. 196-209 in
  *Illuminations: Essays and Reflections*, ed. Hannah Arendt (Mariner Books,
  2019).

* Carlo Ginzburg, "The Inquisitor as Anthropologist," pp. 156-164 in *Clues,
  Myths, and the Historical Method* (JHU Press, 1989).

* Maya Soifer, "Beyond convivencia: critical reflections on the historiography
  of interfaith relations in Christian Spain,' *Journal of Medieval Iberian
  Studies* 1:1 (2009), pp. 19-35.

## The Broad Strokes (Sep. 1)

This week, each of you will pick one of three recent general overviews of the
Spanish Inquisition, and read them with an eye for the fundamental historical
questions that shape the more specialist historiography. What do these works
elide, and what do they put to the forefront?

Please choose one of the following monographs (and hopefully we'll have all
three represented!?):

* Henry Kamen, *The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision* (Yale, 1998).  
* Joseph Perez, *The Spanish Inquisition* (Yale, 2005).
* Helen Rawlings, *The Spanish Inquisition* (Blackwell, 2006).

## Conversos and the Jewish Heresy (Sep. 8) 

The nominal justification of Reina Isabel de Castilla for sponsoring the
Inquisition was to guard the purity of the Spanish Church, particularly from
the threat posed by "judiazers." This week, we're looking at what
microhistories of four converso prosecutions can tell us about the converso and
Jewish experience under the Inquisition on both sides of the Atlantic.

  Iberian Wold*. Indiana Univ. Press, 2007.

  Memory in Toledo," *Loa corónica* 41.1 (Falll 2012): 235-262.


## Locality (Sep. 15) 

The Spanish monarchy, and it's broader empire, was highly decentralized. Even
after the consolidation of Hapsburg rule and its claims to absolute royal
power, conditions were negotiated locally, and manifested in such forms as the
legal customs and charters of the fuero. How did this manifest in the nominally
centralized power of the Holy Office? This week, we look at the operations of
the Inquisition in Guadalupe, Spain. How do historians substantiate motive in
the actions of the Inquisition, and in its identified targets?

  and **Conversos** in Guadalupe, Spain*. Princeton University Press, 2003.

## Moving Up and Out (Sep. 22)

The Atlantic Empire of the Castile is most commonly associated with the Spanish
Empire of the 15th and 16th-century Empire. But, the Crown of Aragon also
managed Spanish imperial power in the Mediterranean. This week looks at the
operations of the Inquisition in Spain's European and Mediterranean
borderlands.

* William Monter, *Frontiers of Heresy: The Spanish INquisition form the Basque
  Lands to Sicily*. Cambridge Univ. Press, 1990.


## Witchcraft? (Sep. 29) 

The predominate imagination around witchcraft in Europe envisions dramatic
trials and public executions that were often absent in Spain and its empire.
Nonetheless, this week we'll consider a provocative account of the interest in
and persecution of witches and witchcraft as a form of primitive accumulation.
