## Week 1  

**Introduction (Aug. 25)**

To get us thinking critically about the concept of History before turning our
attention to the Spanish Inquisition, we will spend some time reading about
History and Progress from a philosophical perspective, and set some primary
categories of method and politics on the table.

We start the semester with four short pieces. Two address the natural and
possible limits of historical knowledge and temporality. Two move us towards
looking over the Inquisitor's shoulder. While reading, consider this big
question: *What is the status of the past?*. 

* Tosaka Jun, "The Principle of Everydayness and Historical Time," pp. 3-16 in
  Ken C. Kawashima, Fabian Sch√§fer, and Robert Stolz, eds., *Tosaka Jun:
  A Critical Reader* (Columbia University East Asia Program, 2013).

* Walter Benjamin, "Theses on the Philosophy of History," pp. 196-209 in
  *Illuminations: Essays and Reflections*, ed. Hannah Arendt (Mariner Books,
  2019).

* Carlo Ginzburg, "The Inquisitor as Anthropologist," pp. 156-164 in *Clues,
  Myths, and the Historical Method* (JHU Press, 1989).

* Maya Soifer, "Beyond convivencia: critical reflections on the historiography
  of interfaith relations in Christian Spain,' *Journal of Medieval Iberian
  Studies* 1:1 (2009), pp. 19-35.

## Week 2 

**The Broad Strokes (Sep. 1)**

This week, each of you will pick one of three recent general overviews of the
Spanish Inquisition, and read them with an eye for the fundamental historical
questions that shape the more specialist historiography. What do these works
elide, and what do they put to the forefront?

Please choose one of the following monographs (and hopefully we'll have all
three represented!?):

* Henry Kamen, *The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision* (Yale, 1998).  
* Joseph Perez, *The Spanish Inquisition* (Yale, 2005).
* Helen Rawlings, *The Spanish Inquisition* (Blackwell, 2006).
