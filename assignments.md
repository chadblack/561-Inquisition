# assignments {#history}

Given the likelihood that this semester will happen in a Microsoft
Teams video window, we will need to front load our discussion asynchronously
online. 

1. Leading Discussion. Each of you will lead discussion twice this semester. As
   discussion leader, you'll bring together the questions and comments from
   pre-class chats, look at reviews, and put together a series of questions to
   help guide our discussion. We need to read these books simultaneously in
   a three ways: 1. For the internal structure; 2. For its intervention in the
   literature; 3. For its relevance and coherence to today.

2. Pre-meeting chats. In order to keep our video sessions at a reasonable
   length, I would like us to set-up our synchronous discussions with some
   pre-meeting chats. There are two ways to do this-- finish the assigned
   readings completely before you post, or post along the way as you are
   thinking through things. You may pose questions, observations about the
   three types of reading listed above, etc. You may also post in response to
   each other. If we can get some good work done in the chat no later than Sunday evening
   and Monday, your comrade-at-arms on Tuesday will be in a good place to take
   us deeper into discussion.

3. Primary source papers. Twice during the semester you will write papers
   analytical papers using the two source readers assigned for the semester.
   Pick a theme and chose a set of documents to investigate that theme.
   Complement the documents with our secondary reading and any research you
   deem necessary to analyze the documents. You can write on procedure, on the
   implication to historical method or philosophy more generally, on a thematic
   concern, etc. Be adventuresome and smart. We will discuss your papers in
   Week 8 (Homza Reader) and Week 14 (Chuchiack Reader).
