The Spanish Inquisition lives on in the popular imagination more than five
hundred years after it was established in 1478. Monty Python taught us no
one expected it. Mel Brooks turned it into a song. This dark humor worked
to de-fang an institution associated with the worst impulses of religious
intolerance and persecution. This course will look at the long history of
the Spanish Inquisition on the Iberian peninsula and in the Americas to go
beyond secret trails, torture, and autos-da-fe to understand why the
Inquisition was established, its institutional role was in Spanish rule,
and its legacies for the modern world.
